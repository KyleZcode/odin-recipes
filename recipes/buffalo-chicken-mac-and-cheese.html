    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I love buffalo chicken wings, but I find them incredibly unfilling. This recipe gets you that same flavor, in a form that will stick to your ribs.  Plus, you might find that you have more than enough to enjoy leftovers from this for some easy lunches. I usually double this recpie and cook it in a 9x13 baking dish.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>8 oz dry macaroni noodles</li>
      <li>3 Tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>3 Tablespoons flour</li>
      <li>2 cups milk</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
      <li>4 oz cream cheese</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>1 cup sharp shredded cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>1/3 cup sour cream</li>
      <li>1/2 cup buffalo hot sauce</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups shredded chicken</li>
      <li>1 Tablespoon butter</li>
      <li>1/2 Tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1/2 cup seasoned panko crumbs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350F and lightly grease a 9Ã—9 square baking dish with butter.</li>
      <li>Cook pasta al dente according to package instructions.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Once it has melted, add flour and stir until smooth.</li>
      <li>Add milk and spices, stir well and bring to a boil.</li>
      <li>Once mixture begins to boil, reduce heat, bring to a simmer, and stir frequently until it is slightly thickened.</li>
      <li>Reduce heat to low and add cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, cheddar cheese, and sour cream. Stir until cheeses are melted and mixture is smooth.</li>
      <li>Add hot sauce and stir.</li>
      <li>Add shredded chicken and cooked, drained pasta noodles and stir until well coated by the sauce.</li>
      <li>Pour into prepared baking dish and prepare your Panko topping.</li>
      <li>Combine butter and olive oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Heat, stirring occasionally, until melted.</li>
      <li>Add panko and stir well until the butter and oil has been mostly absorbed. Continue to stir until panko is lightly toasted and turns a light-medium brown color.</li>
      <li>Use a spoon to sprinkle over prepared buffalo chicken mac and cheese.</li>
      <li>Transfer to oven and bake on 350F for 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
